            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Remy. Californian-born and -rasied, I graduated from Pasadena High School in 2023. I'm currently studying Computer Science at [college]. <a href="https://remy.backpacking.rabideau.org" target="_blank">Backpacking</a> is my true passion; I've been on over 30 trips since I was five.
        </p>

            What I've Done
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)
        </h3>
        <p>
            Digital Elevation Models are models that can represent Earth's surface in different ways. In 2022, I worked on a solo project that took custom data—in the form of a .tif file—and calculated the most efficient off-trail route between two points in a wilderness setting. The repo can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/remy-rabideau/digital-elevation-models" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <h3>
            Kiwanis, KIWIN'S, and Circle K
        </h3>
        <p>
            During grade 11 of high school, I co-founded an official KIWIN'S club at Pasadena High. I owe thanks to my co-founder for sticking with me and to the Kiwanis Club of Pasadena for graciously chartering and supporting us. Now, as a college student, I'm resuming my Kiwanis life as a Circle K member at [college].
