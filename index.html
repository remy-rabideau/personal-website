        <p>
            Hi! I'm Remy. Californian-born and -rasied, I graduated from Pasadena High School in 2023. I'm currently studying Computer Science at [college].

                        Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)

                    <p>
                        Digital Elevation Models are models that can represent Earth's surface in different ways. In 2022, I worked on a solo project that takes custom data—in the form of a .tif file—and calculates the most efficient off-trail route between two points in a wilderness setting. The repo can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/remy-rabideau/digital-elevation-models" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        During grade 11 of high school, I co-founded an official KIWIN'S club at Pasadena High. I owe thanks to my co-founder for sticking with me and to the Kiwanis Club of Pasadena for graciously chartering and supporting us. Now, as a college student, I'm resuming my Kiwanis life as a Circle K member at [college].

                        Since I was five years old, I have been on over 30 backpacking trips in primarily California, but also in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alberta.
